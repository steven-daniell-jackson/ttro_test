Test Description:
Create a small application that allows a user to register on a site.

The registration process must have:
email address
Password
Password confirmation
Hobbies
Hobbie image

DONE - The form must have a little plus icon that the user can click to dynamically add another hobby field. The user can dynamically add up to 4 hobby fields.

The site will email confirmation of the registration.

The user will be required to click on the 'confirm' registration link before they may log onto the application.

DONE - The user will be able to upload an image to the application that is no bigger than 2Mb for each hobbie (the image is not important, it can be of anything).

DONE - The system must categorize the image according to 2 criteria: Landscape or Portrait.

DONE - The application must automatically scale the image to have a maximum height of 200px and create a thumbnail, and save the resized image and thumbnail into a logical location.

The user must then be able to view a thumbnail gallery with the hobbie title below the image. 

The gallery can only show 6 images at a time. The developer must make use of pagination if there are more than 6 images in the gallery.

The user must be able to sort the gallery based on the criteria 'Landscape', 'Portrait' or 'All'.

Any additional features and enhancements that the developer can add to the application will be to their benefit.

All code and database files must be submitted along with any installation instructions should those be necessary.
